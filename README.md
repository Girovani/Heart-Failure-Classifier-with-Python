# Heart-Failure-Classifier-with-Python
That's a task provided by the kaggle that consist in making a classifier algorith that can predict  heart attack using blood information and a few other features.

in this project I tried 3 diferents machile learning models, the random forest classifier, SVC and the logistic regressor, two of them worked well in the data frame, but the SVC don't worked properly so I decided to remove him from the notebook, in this project I'm focusing in the analysis of the data, but this lack feature engineering.

also in this project I'm don't have started using github yet, so again I hope you understand that and download the data for run the code.
