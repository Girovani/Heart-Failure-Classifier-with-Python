# Heart-Failure-Classifier-with-Python
That's a task provided by the kaggle that consist in making a classifier algorithm that can predict  heart attack using blood information and a few other features.

in this project I tried 3 diferents machine learning models, the random forest classifier, SVC and the logistic regressor, two of them worked well in the data frame, but the SVC didn't worked properly so I decided to remove him from the notebook, in this project I'm focusing in the analysis of the data, but this lack feature engineering.

also in this project I didn't have started using github yet, so again I hope you understand that and download the data to run the code.
